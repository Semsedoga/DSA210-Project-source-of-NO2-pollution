# NO2 Pollution vs. Vehicular Traffic 

## Project Overview
Air pollution is a critical environmental issue of our decade, and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a chemical compound that is a member of the nitrogen oxides (NOx) group of extremely reactive gasses. These are the key pollutants primarily emitted by vehicular traffic. 

This study aims to analyze the impact of traffic on NO₂ emissions in Istanbul by collecting data on ground measurement stations from the specific districts of Istanbul that will be taken from the website of the Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change. The stations will be chosen according to the high intensity of NO2 emissions and the consistency of data. The traffic data will be taken from the website of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.

By analyzing NO₂ concentration levels at different times of the day and varying traffic densities, this project aims to identify correlations between traffic volume and pollution levels. Based on the analysis and findings, the primary sources of NO₂ emissions will be determined.

## Motivation 
Air pollution, particularly NO₂ emissions from traffic, is a major concern in urban areas like Istanbul. With heavy congestion affecting air quality, this study aims to analyze the relationship between traffic volume and NO₂ levels using data from two monitoring stations. The findings will help identify key pollution sources and support sustainable traffic management strategies.

### Hypothesis 
Higher traffic volume leads to increased NO₂ emissions, with peak hours showing the highest concentrations.

## Data Sources
This study utilizes two primary data sources: Ground measurement stations from the specific districts of Istanbul that will be taken from the website of the Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change and the traffic data will be taken from the website of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.
